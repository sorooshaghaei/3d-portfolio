  Tech Component:
  - This component maps over the `technologies` array, which contains objects with `name` and `icon` properties.
  - For each technology, it renders a `BallCanvas` component, passing `technology.icon` as the `icon` prop.
  - `BallCanvas` then passes this `icon` prop to the `Ball` component as `imgUrl`.
  - In `Ball`, `imgUrl` is loaded as a texture using `useTexture` and applied to the ballâ€™s surface through the `Decal` component.
  - This flow allows each technology icon to be displayed as a decal on its own floating 3D ball.
